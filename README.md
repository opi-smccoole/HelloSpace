# HelloSpace
A simple, very contrived sample application for my "Tips, Tricks (and little things you (might've) missed) About iOS Development" talk given at the [MSP Mobile Talks](https://www.meetup.com/msp-mobile-talks/) user group meeting on 02/06/2024.

The project is configured with the following tools and utilites for demonstration purposes:
* [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
* [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen)
* [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)

It also provides examples of how to switch back to full Info.plist files and disable the automatic type generation of Image and Color assets in Xcode 15 to work properly with XcodeGen and SwiftGen.
